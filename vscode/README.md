# AgentShield for VS Code

**Inline security findings for AI agent extensions — MCP, LangChain, CrewAI, OpenClaw.**

AgentShield scans your AI agent tools for command injection, SSRF, credential exfiltration, and 9 other vulnerability patterns. Findings appear as inline squiggles and in the Problems panel.

## Features

- **Inline diagnostics** — security findings shown directly in the editor with severity-colored underlines
- **Automatic scanning** — rescans on file save (debounced, configurable)
- **Status bar** — shows scan status and finding count
- **12 detectors** — SHIELD-001 through SHIELD-012 covering command injection, SSRF, credential leaks, arbitrary file access, and more
- **4 frameworks** — MCP servers, OpenClaw skills, CrewAI agents, LangChain tools

## Requirements

AgentShield CLI must be installed:

```bash
# From crates.io
cargo install agent-shield

# Or download from releases
# https://github.com/limaronaldo/agentshield/releases/latest
```
